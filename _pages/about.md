This is my personal website for documenting what I’ve learned — including study notes, coding experiments, project development, and technical reflections.

The purpose of this site is to:

- Organize and structure what I learn  
- Record problems I’ve encountered and how I solved them  
- Save useful code snippets, config steps, and CLI commands  
- Track the progress of projects with detailed logs  
- Practice explaining technical topics clearly  

The main content includes:

- **Programming**: Notes on Python, Shell, MATLAB, and other languages  
- **Systems & Networking**: Linux setup, network tools, performance tuning  
- **Web Development**: Practical code and troubleshooting for frontend/backend  
- **Project Logs**: Tools, scripts, and software I’ve built or experimented with  
- **Problem Solving**: Debugging errors, weird behavior, and how I fixed them  
- **Notes & Reflections**: Concepts I’ve understood while reading docs or building things  

This site is a continuous work in progress — a place to grow, review, and build a personal archive of my learning journey.
